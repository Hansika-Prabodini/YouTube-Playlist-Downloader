 # Example environment configuration for local development only.
 #
 # Usage:
 #   1) Copy this file to `.env` in the repository root:
 #        cp .env.example .env
 #   2) Edit `.env` and set your local secrets. Example:
 #        OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your_key_here...
 #
 # Important:
 # - NEVER commit your real secrets. The `.env` file is gitignored.
 # - Prefer setting environment variables directly in your shell or CI/CD
 #   system instead of storing secrets in files wherever possible.
 # - Rotate your key immediately if it is ever exposed or accidentally committed.
 #
 # In CI and production, prefer secure secret managers or environment variables.
 
 # OpenAI API key (leave blank here; set locally in your .env)
 OPENAI_API_KEY=
